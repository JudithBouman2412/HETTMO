HETerogeneous Transmission MOdel -- R package

This package contains a Bayesian workflow for modelling respiratory infectious diseases with time-varying transmission in Stan. 

It includes three methods for implementing the time-varying transmission: Brownian motion, B-splines and Gaussian processes. 

The package relies on functionality of cmdstanR.
